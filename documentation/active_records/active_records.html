<h2 align=center>active_records library</h2>

<p>
active_records is class library which deal with storage scheme and
simplify it's representation to application, so the programmer could
concentrate on writing classes and not worry about underlying storage.
It has two major futures: ability to add properties to classes based
on elements in the storage, and possibility to create storage schemas
based on properties of given class. In general, just as active records
pattern the library use terminology and is implemented with the assumption
that the underlying storage is relational database. However there are
possibility to use any kind of storage not just database, that depend on
user to provide specific class to the library which implements the library
storage handling interface. Storage independence is much like file descriptors
in Unix like operating system.
