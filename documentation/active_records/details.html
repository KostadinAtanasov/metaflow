<h3 align=center>active_records library implementation details</h3>

<p>
The library consist of three main parts:
ActiveRecord class, DbGenerator class, and that what is shared between them
DbAdapter class. DbAdapter is the part which deal with the database almost
directly, the only intermidiate step between it and database is instance
of some specific adapter classes(such as SqliteAdapter, MySqlAdapter, etc),
which deal directly with the database provided API. DbGenerator, through
DbAdapter, create specific tables in database, the type of tables are
defined by provided string, or by parsing metaflow metalang in the class
variable __metalang__ of derived from DbGenerator class. ActiveRecord is
quite the oposit of DbGenerator - it set attributes of derived from it
class based on content of database table, it also access the database
through DbAdapter.
